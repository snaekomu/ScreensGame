# ScreensGame
Old prototype for a small Unity game; built for TAMK.

As this is a class assignment it is by no means optimized and the difficulty is not adjusted either. The repo exists to showcase the code, rather than provide a playable demo.

## Build instructions:

Clone repository and open with Unity, build from Unity's build menu.

## Controls:

Move: `W, A, S, D`
Change tool: `Left, Right`
Rotate fence: `Up, Down`
